# Data Science

<p>This 5 ECTS Data Science course at Ã…bo Akademi was my first touch with data analysis and machine learning.</p>

<p>This course consisted of three projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Recipe Scraping Project:</b> I scraped a recipe site with Beautiful Soup and performed some simple visual data analysis on the results.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Grade Prediction Project:</b> This was my first machine learning project, a classification task. I used class data on student's activity levels to predict their course grade.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Art Collection NetworkX Project:</b> I used data from a art history portal to display relationships between artists and different art movements.</p></li>
</ul>
